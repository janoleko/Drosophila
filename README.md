This repository contains **R** code for conducting the analysis in the
paper [“Inference on the state process of periodically inhomogeneous
hidden Markov models for animal
behavior”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14583) which can be replicated by
executing `Analysis.R`.

In the paper we establish important mathematical properties that allow
for comprehensive statistical inference related to periodically
inhomogeneous hidden Markov models thereby providing guidance for model
building and model checking. Specifically, we derive the periodically
varying unconditional state distribution as well as the time-varying and
overall state dwell-time distributions – all of which are of key
interest when the inferential focus lies on the dynamics of the state
process.

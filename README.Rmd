This repository contains **R** code for conducting the analysis in the paper ["Inference on the state process of periodically inhomogeneous hidden Markov models for animal behavior"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14583) which can be replicated by executing `Analysis.R`.

In the paper we establish important mathematical properties that allow for comprehensive statistical inference related to periodically inhomogeneous hidden Markov models thereby providing guidance for model building and model checking. Specifically, we derive the periodically varying unconditional state distribution as well as the time-varying and overall state dwell-time distributions -- all of which are of key interest when the inferential focus lies on the dynamics of the state process.
